* **Designed**: The analyst makes very deliberate decisions in light of audience and purpose.
]

--

.small-font[
* **Partial**: Essential information is prioritised and made salient, with abstraction and brevity preferred over complexity and completeness.
]

--

.small-font[
* **Intuitive**: Visual narratives take advantage of our natural tendency to communicate via metaphor and story, with a clear "entry point" and clear progression.
]

--

.small-font[
* **Compelling**: Visual stories often capture attention through an array of graphical devices -- sequence, animation and interaction. They generate an aesthetic response.
]

--

.small-font[
* **Relatable and situated**: Visual stories promote empathy, using devices that place the audience in the story setting.
]

--

.small-font[
* **Political**: Visual data stories often promote with clarity particular voices, interpretations or positions.
