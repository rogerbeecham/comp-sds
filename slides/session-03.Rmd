<!-- ## Conceptual Element

.small-font[
1. Recognise the **characteristics of effective data graphics**.

2. Understand that there is a **grammar of graphics**, and that this grammar underpins modern **visualization toolkits**.

3. Be aware of the **vocabulary** used by these toolkits -- that of **encoding data through visual channels**.

4. Be able to **select appropriate visual channels** given a data itemâ€™s measurement type.

5. Appreciate how visual channels and evidence of their encoding effectiveness can be used to **evaluate data graphics**.

Fundamenrals :
* position on what vis is and should do
* processes of creating and evaluating data graphics
* vocabulary for this
* using 2019 General Election

## Characteristics of effective data graphics

???

Data vis is a varied field but effective data graphics have ...
--
.tiny-font[
* Represent **complex datasets** graphically to **expose structure, connections and comparisons** that could not be achieved easily via other means.
]

--
.tiny-font[
* Are data rich: present **many numbers in a small space**.
]

--

.tiny-font[
* Reveal **patterns** at **several levels of detail**: from broad overview to fine structure.
]

--

.tiny-font[
* Have elegance : emphasise dimensions of a dataset **without extraneous detail**.
]

--
.tiny-font[
* Generate an **aesthetic response** that encourages people to **engage** with the data or question.

Data vis is a careful thinking through of data you have -- its type -- how it ican be represented using the visual system -- and to support particular analysis tasks.

Data - Visuals -- Tasks

## Grammar of Graphics

```{r gog, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Components of Wickham 2010's Layered Grammar of Graphics.", fig.align="left", out.width="50%"}

Already you will notice that I am describing graphics in a consistent way.

There are advantages of doing this.

GoG -- written byWilkinson in late 1990s -- captures process of turning data into visuals.

Graphics have this underlying structure -- levels.

## Marks and visual channels

> Effective data visualization design is concerned with representing data through **marks** and **visual channels** in a way that best conveys the properties of the data that are to be depicted.

Marks > geom
Channels > aes

## Marks and visual channels

Two categories > data type
Some more effective than others

We can use this to evaluate designs on their encoding effectiveness

Also mention symbilisation

## Checking perceptual rankings: preattentive processing

```{r no-encoding, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../class/03-class_files/no-encoding.png", error = FALSE)

```{r area-encoding, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../class/03-class_files/area-encoding.png", error = FALSE)
```

```{r angle-encoding, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../class/03-class_files/angle-encoding.png", error = FALSE)
```

```{r hue-encoding, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../class/03-class_files/hue-encoding.png", error = FALSE)
```

Notes -- different tasks

That certain of these take advantage of preattentive processing.

Precision with which we can judge correlation as it increases is non-linear.
