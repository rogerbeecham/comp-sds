Last session : heavy conceptual content

EDA : more practical

EDA : expose properties and structure of a dataset, and from here suggest directions for analytic inquiry.

In an EDA, relationships are quickly inferred, anomalies labelled, assumptions tested and new hypotheses and ideas are formulated

Do so with Stats19 -- how detailed comparison across many categorical variables can be effected using colour, layout and statistical computation

.small-font[
Two (initial) goals that EDA should address:]
--
.small-font[
1. What type of **variation** occurs **within** variables of a dataset?
2. What type of **covariation** occurs **between** variables of a dataset?
]

Exploring structure and relationships

## EDA and statistical graphics

## Variation within continuous variables

include_graphics("../class/04-class_files/univariate-plots.png", error = FALSE)
```

 *strip-plot* :
 x-position, random vertical perturbation.
 Scale poorly, but no need to impose an aggregation.
 Location of the distribution – denser dots towards 20-25 age range – but also degree of spread across the age values.

*Histograms* partition continuous variables into equal-range bins.
Give distributions a “shape” that is expressive.
Easy to identify location of a distribution and estimate relative densities between different parts of the distribution.

Despite the heavy spread, the distribution of casualty_age is right-skewed, and we’d expect this given the location of the mean (36 years) relative to the median (33 years).

 artificial edge-effects around the bins. Density plots overcome this -- smoothed histograms. Kernel density estimation (KDE) to show the probability density function of a variable – the relative amount of probability attached to each value of casualty_age.

 Overall “shape” to the distribution can be immediately derived.

 It is also possible to infer statistical properties: the mode of the distribution (the highest density), the mean (by visual averaging) and median (finding the midpoint of the area under the curve).

 Reasonably large number of observations needed due to the smoothing function it is possible to generate a density plot that suggests nonsensical values (e.g. negative ages in this case if I hadn’t censored the plot range).

Boxplots encode the statistical properties directly but introduce hard borders.

Pedestrians younger than the drivers hitting them, except for bikes. But notice differences in spread between drivers and pedestrians/

## Variation within and between categorical variables

???

Are crashes involving certain vehicle associated with more/less severe injury than others?

.tiny-font[
> EDA is often thought of as an alternative to model-based statistical analysis, but once we think of **graphs as comparisons to models**, it makes sense that the amount we've learned increases with the complexity of the model being compared to. **Effective graphics** create visual structures that **enable model inspection** by foregrounding comparisons of interest in ways that exploit the abilities of the human visual systems.


> We propose a perspective that **unites exploratory and confirmatory analysis** through the idea of **graphs as model checks** [...] and describe how [...] systems for exploratory visual analysis should be designed to **better support model-driven inference and representation of uncertainty**.

EDA should invite comparison -- we can achieve this with out vis design.
